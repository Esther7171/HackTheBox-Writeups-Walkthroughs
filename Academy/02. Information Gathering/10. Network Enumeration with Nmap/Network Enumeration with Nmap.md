### Module Summary

Nmap is used to identify and scan systems on the network. It is an important part of network diagnostics and evaluation of network-connected systems. In this module, we will learn the basics of this tool and how it can be used efficiently to map out the internal network by identifying live hosts and performing port scanning, service enumeration, and operating system detection.

In this module, we will cover:

-   An overview of Nmap
-   Host discovery and port scanning
-   Saving scan results
-   Service enumeration
-   Using the powerful Nmap scripting language
-   Firewall and IDS/IPS evasion

This module is broken down into sections with accompanying hands-on exercises to practice each of the tactics and techniques we cover. The module ends with three hands-on labs of increasing difficulty to gauge your understanding of the various topic areas.

As you work through the module, you will see example commands and command output for the various topics introduced. It is worth reproducing as many of these examples as possible to reinforce further the concepts introduced in each section. You can do this in the Pwnbox provided in the interactive sections or your own virtual machine.

You can start and stop the module at any time and pick up where you left off. There is no time limit or "grading," but you must complete all of the exercises and the labs to receive the maximum number of cubes and have this module marked as complete in any paths you have chosen.

The module is classified as "Easy" but assumes a working knowledge of the Linux command line and an understanding of information security fundamentals.

A firm grasp of the following modules can be considered prerequisites for successful completion of this module:

-   Introduction to Networking
-   Linux Fundamentals

## Introduction

### Enumeration

* * * * *

`Enumeration` is the most critical part of all. The art, the difficulty, and the goal are not to gain access to our target computer. Instead, it is identifying all of the ways we could attack a target we must find.

It is not just based on the tools we use. They won't do much good if we don't know what to do with the information we get from them. The tools are just tools that we should never replace with our knowledge and our attention to detail. Here it is much more about actively interacting with the individual services to see what information they provide us and what possibilities they offer us.

It is essential to understand how these services work and what syntax they use for effective communication and interaction with the different services.

This phase aims to improve our knowledge and understanding of the technologies, protocols, and how they work and learn to deal with new information and adapt to our already acquired knowledge. Enumeration is collecting as much information as possible. The more information we have, the easier it will be for us to find vectors of attack.

Imagine the following situation:

>Our partner is not at home and has misplaced our car keys. We call our partner and ask where the keys are. If we get an answer like "in the living room," it is entirely unclear and can take much time to find them there. However, what if our partner tells us something like "in the living room on the white shelf, next to the TV, in the third drawer"? As a result, it will be much easier to find them.

It's not hard to get access to the target system once we know how to do it. Most of the ways we can get access we can narrow down to the following two points:

-   `Functions and/or resources that allow us to interact with the target and/or provide additional information.`

-   `Information that provides us with even more important information to access our target.`

When scanning and inspecting, we look exactly for these two possibilities. Most of the information we get comes from misconfigurations or neglect of security for the respective services. Misconfigurations are either the result of ignorance or a wrong security mindset. For example, if the administrator only relies on the firewall, Group Policy Objects (GPOs), and continuous updates, it is often not enough to secure the network.

`Enumeration is the key`.

That's what most people say, and they are right. However, it is too often misunderstood. Most people understand that they haven't tried all the tools to get the information they need. Most of the time, however, it's not the tools we haven't tried, but rather the fact that we don't know how to interact with the service and what's relevant.

That's precisely the reason why so many people stay stuck in one spot and don't get ahead. Had these people invested a couple of hours learning more about the service, how it works, and what it is meant for, they would save a few hours or even days from reaching their goal and get access to the system.

`Manual enumeration` is a `critical` component. Many scanning tools simplify and accelerate the process. However, these cannot always bypass the security measures of the services. The easiest way to illustrate this is to use the following example:

>Most scanning tools have a timeout set until they receive a response from the service. If this tool does not respond within a specific time, this service/port will be marked as closed, filtered, or unknown. In the last two cases, we will still be able to work with it. However, if a port is marked as closed and Nmap doesn't show it to us, we will be in a bad situation. This service/port may provide us with the opportunity to find a way to access the system. Therefore, this result can take much unnecessary time until we find it.

### Introduction to Nmap

* * * * *

Network Mapper (`Nmap`) is an open-source network analysis and security auditing tool written in C, C++, Python, and Lua. It is designed to scan networks and identify which hosts are available on the network using raw packets, and services and applications, including the name and version, where possible. It can also identify the operating systems and versions of these hosts. Besides other features, Nmap also offers scanning capabilities that can determine if packet filters, firewalls, or intrusion detection systems (IDS) are configured as needed.

* * * * *

### Use Cases
---------

The tool is one of the most used tools by network administrators and IT security specialists. It is used to:

-   Audit the security aspects of networks
-   Simulate penetration tests
-   Check firewall and IDS settings and configurations
-   Types of possible connections
-   Network mapping
-   Response analysis
-   Identify open ports
-   Vulnerability assessment as well.

* * * * *

### Nmap Architecture
-----------------

Nmap offers many different types of scans that can be used to obtain various results about our targets. Basically, Nmap can be divided into the following scanning techniques:

-   Host discovery
-   Port scanning
-   Service enumeration and detection
-   OS detection
-   Scriptable interaction with the target service (Nmap Scripting Engine)

* * * * *

### Syntax
------

The syntax for Nmap is fairly simple and looks like this:

	nmap <scan types> <options> <target>

* * * * *

### Scan Techniques
---------------

Nmap offers many different scanning techniques, making different types of connections and using differently structured packets to send. Here we can see all the scanning techniques Nmap offers:

	nmap --help

```text
<SNIP>
SCAN TECHNIQUES:
  -sS/sT/sA/sW/sM: TCP SYN/Connect()/ACK/Window/Maimon scans
  -sU: UDP Scan
  -sN/sF/sX: TCP Null, FIN, and Xmas scans
  --scanflags <flags>: Customize TCP scan flags
  -sI <zombie host[:probeport]>: Idle scan
  -sY/sZ: SCTP INIT/COOKIE-ECHO scans
  -sO: IP protocol scan
  -b <FTP relay host>: FTP bounce scan
<SNIP>
```

For example, the TCP-SYN scan (`-sS`) is one of the default settings unless we have defined otherwise and is also one of the most popular scan methods. This scan method makes it possible to scan several thousand ports per second. The TCP-SYN scan sends one packet with the SYN flag and, therefore, never completes the three-way handshake, which results in not establishing a full TCP connection to the scanned port.

-   If our target sends an `SYN-ACK` flagged packet back to the scanned port, Nmap detects that the port is `open`.
-   If the packet receives an `RST` flag, it is an indicator that the port is `closed`.
-   If Nmap does not receive a packet back, it will display it as `filtered`. Depending on the firewall configuration, certain packets may be dropped or ignored by the firewall.

Let us take an example of such a scan.

	sudo nmap -sS localhost

```text
Starting Nmap 7.80 ( https://nmap.org ) at 2020-06-11 22:50 UTC

5901/tcp open  vnc-1

Nmap done: 1 IP address (1 host up) scanned in 0.18 seconds
```

## Host Enumeration

### Host Discovery

* * * * *

When we need to conduct an internal penetration test for the entire network of a company, for example, then we should, first of all, get an overview of which systems are online that we can work with. To actively discover such systems on the network, we can use various `Nmap` host discovery options. There are many options `Nmap` provides to determine whether our target is alive or not. The most effective host discovery method is to use ICMP echo requests, which we will look into.

It is always recommended to store every single scan. This can later be used for comparison, documentation, and reporting. After all, different tools may produce different results. Therefore it can be beneficial to distinguish which tool produces which results.

#### Scan Network Range

	sudo nmap 10.129.2.0/24 -sn -oA tnet | grep for | cut -d" " -f5

```text
10.129.2.4
10.129.2.10
10.129.2.11
10.129.2.18
10.129.2.19
10.129.2.20
10.129.2.28
```

#### Used Scanning Options

| 10.129.2.0/24 | -sn | -oA tnet |
| --- | --- | --- |

This scanning method works only if the firewalls of the hosts allow it. Otherwise, we can use other scanning techniques to find out if the hosts are active or not. We will take a closer look at these techniques in "`Firewall and IDS Evasion`".

* * * * *

Scan IP List
------------

During an internal penetration test, it is not uncommon for us to be provided with an IP list with the hosts we need to test. `Nmap` also gives us the option of working with lists and reading the hosts from this list instead of manually defining or typing them in.

Such a list could look something like this:

	cat hosts.lst

```text
10.129.2.4
10.129.2.10
10.129.2.11
10.129.2.18
10.129.2.19
10.129.2.20
10.129.2.28
```

If we use the same scanning technique on the predefined list, the command will look like this:

	sudo nmap -sn -oA tnet -iL hosts.lst | grep for | cut -d" " -f5

```text
10.129.2.18
10.129.2.19
10.129.2.20
```

#### Used Scanning Options

| -sn | -oA tnet | -iL hosts.lst |
| --- | --- | --- |

In this example, we see that only 3 of 7 hosts are active. Remember, this may mean that the other hosts ignore the default ICMP echo requests because of their firewall configurations. Since `Nmap` does not receive a response, it marks those hosts as inactive.

* * * * *

### Scan Multiple IPs
-----------------

It can also happen that we only need to scan a small part of a network. An alternative to the method we used last time is to specify multiple IP addresses.

	sudo nmap -sn -oA tnet 10.129.2.18 10.129.2.19 10.129.2.20| grep for | cut -d" " -f5

```text
10.129.2.18
10.129.2.19
10.129.2.20
```

If these IP addresses are next to each other, we can also define the range in the respective octet.

	sudo nmap -sn -oA tnet 10.129.2.18-20| grep for | cut -d" " -f5

```text
10.129.2.18
10.129.2.19
10.129.2.20
```

* * * * *

### Scan Single IP
--------------

Before we scan a single host for open ports and its services, we first have to determine if it is alive or not. For this, we can use the same method as before.

	sudo nmap 10.129.2.18 -sn -oA host 

```text
Starting Nmap 7.80 ( https://nmap.org ) at 2020-06-14 23:59 CEST
Nmap scan report for 10.129.2.18
Host is up (0.087s latency).
MAC Address: DE:AD:00:00:BE:EF
Nmap done: 1 IP address (1 host up) scanned in 0.11 seconds
```

#### Used Scanning Options

| 10.129.2.18 | -sn | -oA host |
| --- | --- | --- |

If we disable port scan (`-sn`), Nmap automatically ping scan with `ICMP Echo Requests` (`-PE`). Once such a request is sent, we usually expect an `ICMP reply` if the pinging host is alive. The more interesting fact is that our previous scans did not do that because before Nmap could send an ICMP echo request, it would send an `ARP ping` resulting in an `ARP reply`. We can confirm this with the "`--packet-trace`" option. To ensure that ICMP echo requests are sent, we also define the option (`-PE`) for this.

	sudo nmap 10.129.2.18 -sn -oA host -PE --packet-trace 

```text
Starting Nmap 7.80 ( https://nmap.org ) at 2020-06-15 00:08 CEST

MAC Address: DE:AD:00:00:BE:EF
Nmap done: 1 IP address (1 host up) scanned in 0.05 seconds
```

#### Used Scanning Options

| 10.129.2.18 | -sn | -oA host | -PE | --packet-trace |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |

* * * * *

Another way to determine why Nmap has our target marked as "alive" is with the "`--reason`" option.

	sudo nmap 10.129.2.18 -sn -oA host -PE --reason 

```text
Starting Nmap 7.80 ( https://nmap.org ) at 2020-06-15 00:10 CEST
SENT (0.0074s) ARP who-has 10.129.2.18 tell 10.10.14.2
RCVD (0.0309s) ARP reply 10.129.2.18 is-at DE:AD:00:00:BE:EF
Nmap scan report for 10.129.2.18
Host is up, received arp-response (0.028s latency).
MAC Address: DE:AD:00:00:BE:EF
Nmap done: 1 IP address (1 host up) scanned in 0.03 seconds
```

#### Used Scanning Techniques

| 10.129.2.18 | -sn | -oA host | -PE | --reason |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |

* * * * *

We see here that `Nmap` does indeed detect whether the host is alive or not through the `ARP request` and `ARP reply` alone. To disable ARP requests and scan our target with the desired `ICMP echo requests`, we can disable ARP pings by setting the "`--disable-arp-ping`" option. Then we can scan our target again and look at the packets sent and received.

	sudo nmap 10.129.2.18 -sn -oA host -PE --packet-trace --disable-arp-ping 

```text
Starting Nmap 7.80 ( https://nmap.org ) at 2020-06-15 00:12 CEST
SENT (0.0107s) ICMP [10.10.14.2 > 10.129.2.18 Echo request (type=8/code=0) id=13607 seq=0] IP [ttl=255 id=23541 iplen=28 ]

```

We have already mentioned in the "`Learning Process`," and at the beginning of this module, it is essential to pay attention to details. An `ICMP echo request` can help us determine if our target is alive and identify its system. More strategies about host discovery can be found at:

[https://nmap.org/book/host-discovery-strategies.html](https://nmap.org/book/host-discovery-strategies.html)

#### Questions

>Based on the last result, find out which operating system it belongs to. Submit the name of the operating system as result.

### Host and Port Scanning

* * * * *

It is essential to understand how the tool we use works and how it performs and processes the different functions. We will only understand the results if we know what they mean and how they are obtained. Therefore we will take a closer look at and analyze some of the scanning methods. After we have found out that our target is alive, we want to get a more accurate picture of the system. The information we need includes:

-   Open ports and its services
-   Service versions
-   Information that the services provided
-   Operating system

There are a total of 6 different states for a scanned port we can obtain:

| State | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `open` | This indicates that the connection to the scanned port has been established. These connections can be TCP connections, UDP datagrams as well as SCTP associations. |
| `closed` | When the port is shown as closed, the TCP protocol indicates that the packet we received back contains an `RST` flag. This scanning method can also be used to determine if our target is alive or not. |
| `filtered` | Nmap cannot correctly identify whether the scanned port is open or closed because either no response is returned from the target for the port or we get an error code from the target. |
| `unfiltered` | This state of a port only occurs during the TCP-ACK scan and means that the port is accessible, but it cannot be determined whether it is open or closed. |
| `open|filtered` | If we do not get a response for a specific port, `Nmap` will set it to that state. This indicates that a firewall or packet filter may protect the port. |
| `closed|filtered` | This state only occurs in the IP ID idle scans and indicates that it was impossible to determine if the scanned port is closed or filtered by a firewall. |

* * * * *

### Discovering Open TCP Ports
--------------------------

By default, `Nmap` scans the top 1000 TCP ports with the SYN scan (`-sS`). This SYN scan is set only to default when we run it as root because of the socket permissions required to create raw TCP packets. Otherwise, the TCP scan (`-sT`) is performed by default. This means that if we do not define ports and scanning methods, these parameters are set automatically. We can define the ports one by one (`-p 22,25,80,139,445`), by range (`-p 22-445`), by top ports (`--top-ports=10`) from the `Nmap` database that have been signed as most frequent, by scanning all ports (`-p-`) but also by defining a fast port scan, which contains top 100 ports (`-F`).

#### Scanning Top 10 TCP Ports

	sudo nmap 10.129.2.28 --top-ports=10 

```text
Starting Nmap 7.80 ( https://nmap.org ) at 2020-06-15 15:36 CEST

```

#### Used Scanning Options

| 10.129.2.28 | --top-ports=10 |
| --- | --- |

* * * * *

We see that we only scanned the top 10 TCP ports of our target, and `Nmap` displays their state accordingly. If we trace the packets `Nmap` sends, we will see the `RST` flag on TCP port 21 that our target sends back to us. To have a clear view of the SYN scan, we disable the ICMP echo requests (`-Pn`), DNS resolution (`-n`), and ARP ping scan (`--disable-arp-ping`).

#### Nmap - Trace the Packets

	sudo nmap 10.129.2.28 -p 21 --packet-trace -Pn -n --disable-arp-ping

* * * * *

We can see from the SENT line that we (`10.10.14.2`) sent a TCP packet with the `SYN` flag (`S`) to our target (`10.129.2.28`). In the next RCVD line, we can see that the target responds with a TCP packet containing the `RST` and `ACK` flags (`RA`). `RST` and `ACK` flags are used to acknowledge receipt of the TCP packet (`ACK`) and to end the TCP session (`RST`).

* * * * *

### Filtered Ports
--------------

When a port is shown as filtered, it can have several reasons. In most cases, firewalls have certain rules set to handle specific connections. The packets can either be `dropped`, or `rejected`. When a packet gets dropped, `Nmap` receives no response from our target, and by default, the retry rate (`--max-retries`) is set to 1. This means `Nmap` will resend the request to the target port to determine if the previous packet was not accidentally mishandled.

Let us look at an example where the firewall `drops` the TCP packets we send for the port scan. Therefore we scan the TCP port 139, which was already shown as filtered. To be able to track how our sent packets are handled, we deactivate the ICMP echo requests (`-Pn`), DNS resolution (`-n`), and ARP ping scan (`--disable-arp-ping`) again.

	sudo nmap 10.129.2.28 -p 139 --packet-trace -n --disable-arp-ping -Pn

We see in the last scan that `Nmap` sent two TCP packets with the SYN flag. By the duration (`2.06s`) of the scan, we can recognize that it took much longer than the previous ones (`~0.05s`). The case is different if the firewall rejects the packets. For this, we look at TCP port `445`, which is handled accordingly by such a rule of the firewall.

As a response, we receive an `ICMP` reply with `type 3` and `error code 3`, which indicates that the desired host is unreachable. Nevertheless, if we know that the host is alive, we can strongly assume that the firewall on this port is rejecting the packets, and we will have to take a closer look at this port later.

### Discovering Open UDP Ports
--------------------------

Some system administrators sometimes forget to filter the UDP ports in addition to the TCP ones. Since `UDP` is a `stateless protocol` and does not require a three-way handshake like TCP. We do not receive any acknowledgment. Consequently, the timeout is much longer, making the whole `UDP scan` (`-sU`) much slower than the `TCP scan` (`-sS`).

Let's look at an example of what a UDP scan (`-sU`) can look like and what results it gives us.

	sudo nmap 10.129.2.28 -F -sU

```text

```

#### Used Scanning Options

| --- | --- | --- |

* * * * *

Another disadvantage of this is that we often do not get a response back because `Nmap` sends empty datagrams to the scanned UDP ports, and we do not receive any response. So we cannot determine if the UDP packet has arrived at all or not. If the UDP port is `open`, we only get a response if the application is configured to do so.

### Saving the Results

* * * * *

### Different Formats
-----------------

While we run various scans, we should always save the results. We can use these later to examine the differences between the different scanning methods we have used. `Nmap` can save the results in 3 different formats.

-   Normal output (`-oN`) with the `.nmap` file extension
-   Grepable output (`-oG`) with the `.gnmap` file extension
-   XML output (`-oX`) with the `.xml` file extension

We can also specify the option (`-oA`) to save the results in all formats. The command could look like this:

	sudo nmap 10.129.2.28 -p- -oA target

```text

### Style sheets
------------

With the XML output, we can easily create HTML reports that are easy to read, even for non-technical people. This is later very useful for documentation, as it presents our results in a detailed and clear way. To convert the stored results from XML format to HTML, we can use the tool `xsltproc`.

	xsltproc target.xml -o target.html

If we now open the HTML file in our browser, we see a clear and structured presentation of our results.

#### Questions

>Perform a full TCP port scan on your target and create an HTML report. Submit the number of the highest port as the answer.

### Service Enumeration

* * * * *

For us, it is essential to determine the application and its version as accurately as possible. We can use this information to scan for known vulnerabilities and analyze the source code for that version if we find it. An exact version number allows us to search for a more precise exploit that fits the service and the operating system of our target.

* * * * *

### Service Version Detection
-------------------------

It is recommended to perform a quick port scan first, which gives us a small overview of the available ports. This causes significantly less traffic, which is advantageous for us because otherwise we can be discovered and blocked by the security mechanisms. We can deal with these first and run a port scan in the background, which shows all open ports (`-p-`). We can use the version scan to scan the specific ports for services and their versions (`-sV`).

A full port scan takes quite a long time. To view the scan status, we can press the `[Space Bar]` during the scan, which will cause `Nmap` to show us the scan status.

	sudo nmap 10.129.2.28 -p- -sV

```text
Starting Nmap 7.80 ( https://nmap.org ) at 2020-06-15 19:44 CEST

```

#### Used Scanning Options

* * * * *

Another option (`--stats-every=5s`) that we can use is defining how periods of time the status should be shown. Here we can specify the number of seconds (`s`) or minutes (`m`), after which we want to get the status.

	sudo nmap 10.129.2.28 -p- -sV --stats-every=5s

We can also increase the `verbosity level` (`-v` / `-vv`), which will show us the open ports directly when `Nmap` detects them.

Primarily, `Nmap` looks at the banners of the scanned ports and prints them out. If it cannot identify versions through the banners, `Nmap` attempts to identify them through a signature-based matching system, but this significantly increases the scan's duration. One disadvantage to `Nmap`'s presented results is that the automatic scan can miss some information because sometimes `Nmap` does not know how to handle it. Let us look at an example of this.

	sudo nmap 10.129.2.28 -p- -sV -Pn -n --disable-arp-ping --packet-trace

If we look at the results from `Nmap`, we can see the port's status, service name, and hostname. Nevertheless, let us look at this line here:

-   `NSOCK INFO [0.4200s] nsock_trace_handler_callback(): Callback: READ SUCCESS for EID 18 [10.129.2.28:25] (35 bytes): 220 inlane ESMTP Postfix (Ubuntu)..`

Then we see that the SMTP server on our target gave us more information than `Nmap` showed us. Because here, we see that it is the Linux distribution `Ubuntu`. It happens because, after a successful three-way handshake, the server often sends a banner for identification. This serves to let the client know which service it is working with. At the network level, this happens with a `PSH` flag in the TCP header. However, it can happen that some services do not immediately provide such information. It is also possible to remove or manipulate the banners from the respective services. If we `manually` connect to the SMTP server using `nc`, grab the banner, and intercept the network traffic using `tcpdump`, we can see what `Nmap` did not show us.

The first three lines show us the three-way handshake.

1.  `[SYN]` - `18:28:07.128564 IP 10.10.14.2.59618 > 10.129.2.28.smtp: Flags [S], <SNIP>`
2.  `[SYN-ACK]` - `18:28:07.255151 IP 10.129.2.28.smtp > 10.10.14.2.59618: Flags [S.], <SNIP>`
3.  `[ACK]` - `18:28:07.255281 IP 10.10.14.2.59618 > 10.129.2.28.smtp: Flags [.], <SNIP>`

After that, the target SMTP server sends us a TCP packet with the `PSH` and `ACK` flags, where `PSH` states that the target server is sending data to us and with `ACK` simultaneously informs us that all required data has been sent.

1.  `[PSH-ACK]` - `18:28:07.319306 IP 10.129.2.28.smtp > 10.10.14.2.59618: Flags [P.], <SNIP>`

The last TCP packet that we sent confirms the receipt of the data with an `ACK`.

1.  `[ACK]` - `18:28:07.319426 IP 10.10.14.2.59618 > 10.129.2.28.smtp: Flags [.], <SNIP>`

### Nmap Scripting Engine

* * * * *

Nmap Scripting Engine (`NSE`) is another handy feature of `Nmap`. It provides us with the possibility to create scripts in Lua for interaction with certain services. There are a total of 14 categories into which these scripts can be divided:

| Category | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `auth` | Determination of authentication credentials. |
| `broadcast` | Scripts, which are used for host discovery by broadcasting and the discovered hosts, can be automatically added to the remaining scans. |
| `brute` | Executes scripts that try to log in to the respective service by brute-forcing with credentials. |
| `default` | Default scripts executed by using the `-sC` option. |
| `discovery` | Evaluation of accessible services. |
| `dos` | These scripts are used to check services for denial of service vulnerabilities and are used less as it harms the services. |
| `exploit` | This category of scripts tries to exploit known vulnerabilities for the scanned port. |
| `external` | Scripts that use external services for further processing. |
| `fuzzer` | This uses scripts to identify vulnerabilities and unexpected packet handling by sending different fields, which can take much time. |
| `intrusive` | Intrusive scripts that could negatively affect the target system. |
| `malware` | Checks if some malware infects the target system. |
| `safe` | Defensive scripts that do not perform intrusive and destructive access. |
| `version` | Extension for service detection. |
| `vuln` | Identification of specific vulnerabilities. |

We have several ways to define the desired scripts in `Nmap`.

#### Default Scripts

	sudo nmap <target> -sC

#### Specific Scripts Category

	sudo nmap <target> --script <category>

#### Defined Scripts

	sudo nmap <target> --script <script-name>,<script-name>,...

For example, let us keep working with the target SMTP port and see the results we get with two defined scripts.

#### Nmap - Specifying Scripts

	sudo nmap 10.129.2.28 -p 25 --script banner,smtp-commands

We see that we can recognize the Ubuntu distribution of Linux by using the' banner' script. The `smtp-commands` script shows us which commands we can use by interacting with the target SMTP server. In this example, such information may help us to find out existing users on the target. `Nmap` also gives us the ability to scan our target with the aggressive option (`-A`). This scans the target with multiple options as service detection (`-sV`), OS detection (`-O`), traceroute (`--traceroute`), and with the default NSE scripts (`-sC`).

#### Nmap - Aggressive Scan

	sudo nmap 10.129.2.28 -p 80 -A

With the help of the used scan option (`-A`), we found out what kind of web server (`Apache 2.4.29`) is running on the system, which web application (`WordPress 5.3.4`) is used, and the title (`blog.inlanefreight.com`) of the web page. Also, `Nmap` shows that it is likely to be `Linux` (`96%`) operating system.

* * * * *

### Vulnerability Assessment
------------------------

Now let us move on to HTTP port 80 and see what information and vulnerabilities we can find using the `vuln` category from `NSE`.

#### Nmap - Vuln Category

	sudo nmap 10.129.2.28 -p 80 -sV --script vuln

#### Used Scanning Options

| 10.129.2.28 | -p 80 | -sV | --script vuln |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |

The scripts used for the last scan interact with the webserver and its web application to find out more information about their versions and check various databases to see if there are known vulnerabilities. More information about NSE scripts and the corresponding categories we can find at: <https://nmap.org/nsedoc/index.html>

#### Questions

	sudo nmap -sV -Pn -n -g 53 -p53 -vv --disable-arp-ping --reason --packet-trace 10.129.2.48

### Performance

* * * * *

Scanning performance plays a significant role when we need to scan an extensive network or are dealing with low network bandwidth. We can use various options to tell `Nmap` how fast (`-T <1-5>`), with which frequency (`--min-parallelism <number>`), which timeouts (`--max-rtt-timeout <time>`) the test packets should have, how many packets should be sent simultaneously (`--min-rate <number>`), and with the number of retries (`--max-retries <number>`) for the scanned ports the targets should be scanned.

* * * * *

### Timeouts
--------

When Nmap sends a packet, it takes some time (`Round-Trip-Time` - `RTT`) to receive a response from the scanned port. Generally, `Nmap` starts with a high timeout (`--min-RTT-timeout`) of 100ms. Let us look at an example by scanning the whole network with 256 hosts, including the top 100 ports.

#### Default Scan

	sudo nmap 10.129.2.0/24 -F

```text
<SNIP>
Nmap done: 256 IP addresses (10 hosts up) scanned in 39.44 seconds
```

#### Optimized RTT

	sudo nmap 10.129.2.0/24 -F --initial-rtt-timeout 50ms --max-rtt-timeout 100ms

```text
<SNIP>
Nmap done: 256 IP addresses (8 hosts up) scanned in 12.29 seconds
```

#### Used Scanning Options

| 10.129.2.0/24 | -F | --initial-rtt-timeout 50ms | --max-rtt-timeout 100ms |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |

When comparing the two scans, we can see that we found two hosts less with the optimized scan, but the scan took only a quarter of the time. From this, we can conclude that setting the initial RTT timeout (`--initial-rtt-timeout`) to too short a time period may cause us to overlook hosts.

* * * * *

### Max Retries
-----------

Another way to increase the scans' speed is to specify the retry rate of the sent packets (`--max-retries`). The default value for the retry rate is `10`, so if `Nmap` does not receive a response for a port, it will not send any more packets to the port and will be skipped.

#### Default Scan

	sudo nmap 10.129.2.0/24 -F | grep "/tcp" | wc -l

```text
23
```

#### Reduced Retries

	sudo nmap 10.129.2.0/24 -F --max-retries 0 | grep "/tcp" | wc -l

```text
21
```

#### Used Scanning Options

| 10.129.2.0/24 | -F | --max-retries 0 |
| --- | --- | --- |

Again, we recognize that accelerating can also have a negative effect on our results, which means we can overlook important information.

* * * * *

### Rates
-----

During a white-box penetration test, we may get whitelisted for the security systems to check the systems in the network for vulnerabilities and not only test the protection measures. If we know the network bandwidth, we can work with the rate of packets sent, which significantly speeds up our scans with `Nmap`. When setting the minimum rate (`--min-rate <number>`) for sending packets, we tell `Nmap` to simultaneously send the specified number of packets. It will attempt to maintain the rate accordingly.

#### Default Scan

	sudo nmap 10.129.2.0/24 -F -oN tnet.default

```text
<SNIP>
Nmap done: 256 IP addresses (10 hosts up) scanned in 29.83 seconds
```

#### Optimized Scan

	sudo nmap 10.129.2.0/24 -F -oN tnet.minrate300 --min-rate 300

```text
<SNIP>

```

#### Used Scanning Options

| 10.129.2.0/24 | -F | -oN tnet.minrate300 | --min-rate 300 |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |

* * * * *

```text
23
```

#### Optimized Scan - Found Open Ports

	cat tnet.minrate300 | grep "/tcp" | wc -l

```text
23
```

* * * * *

### Timing
------

Because such settings cannot always be optimized manually, as in a black-box penetration test, `Nmap` offers six different timing templates (`-T <0-5>`) for us to use. These values (`0-5`) determine the aggressiveness of our scans. This can also have negative effects if the scan is too aggressive, and security systems may block us due to the produced network traffic. The default timing template used when we have defined nothing else is the normal (`-T 3`).

-   `-T 0` / `-T paranoid`
-   `-T 1` / `-T sneaky`
-   `-T 2` / `-T polite`
-   `-T 3` / `-T normal`
-   `-T 4` / `-T aggressive`
-   `-T 5` / `-T insane`

These templates contain options that we can also set manually, and have seen some of them already. The developers determined the values set for these templates according to their best results, making it easier for us to adapt our scans to the corresponding network environment. The exact used options with their values we can find here: <https://nmap.org/book/performance-timing-templates.html>

#### Default Scan

	sudo nmap 10.129.2.0/24 -F -oN tnet.default

## Bypass Security Measures

* * * * *

`Nmap` gives us many different ways to bypass firewalls rules and IDS/IPS. These methods include the fragmentation of packets, the use of decoys, and others that we will discuss in this section.

* * * * *

### Firewalls
---------

A firewall is a security measure against unauthorized connection attempts from external networks. Every firewall security system is based on a software component that monitors network traffic between the firewall and incoming data connections and decides how to handle the connection based on the rules that have been set. It checks whether individual network packets are being passed, ignored, or blocked. This mechanism is designed to prevent unwanted connections that could be potentially dangerous.

* * * * *

### IDS/IPS
-------

Like the firewall, the intrusion detection system (`IDS`) and intrusion prevention system (`IPS`) are also software-based components. `IDS` scans the network for potential attacks, analyzes them, and reports any detected attacks. `IPS` complements `IDS` by taking specific defensive measures if a potential attack should have been detected. The analysis of such attacks is based on pattern matching and signatures. If specific patterns are detected, such as a service detection scan, `IPS` may prevent the pending connection attempts.

* * * * *

#### Determine Firewalls and Their Rules

We already know that when a port is shown as filtered, it can have several reasons. In most cases, firewalls have certain rules set to handle specific connections. The packets can either be `dropped`, or `rejected`. The `dropped` packets are ignored, and no response is returned from the host.

This is different for `rejected` packets that are returned with an `RST` flag. These packets contain different types of ICMP error codes or contain nothing at all.

Such errors can be:

-   Net Unreachable
-   Net Prohibited
-   Host Unreachable
-   Host Prohibited
-   Port Unreachable
-   Proto Unreachable

Nmap's TCP ACK scan (`-sA`) method is much harder to filter for firewalls and IDS/IPS systems than regular SYN (`-sS`) or Connect scans (`sT`) because they only send a TCP packet with only the `ACK` flag. When a port is closed or open, the host must respond with an `RST` flag. Unlike outgoing connections, all connection attempts (with the `SYN` flag) from external networks are usually blocked by firewalls. However, the packets with the `ACK` flag are often passed by the firewall because the firewall cannot determine whether the connection was first established from the external network or the internal network.

If we look at these scans, we will see how the results differ.

Please pay attention to the RCVD packets and its set flag we receive from our target. With the SYN scan (`-sS`) our target tries to establish the TCP connection by sending a packet back with the SYN-ACK (`SA`) flags set and with the ACK scan (`-sA`) we get the `RST` flag because TCP port 22 is open. For the TCP port 25, we do not receive any packets back, which indicates that the packets will be dropped.

* * * * *

### Detect IDS/IPS
--------------

Unlike firewalls and their rules, the detection of IDS/IPS systems is much more difficult because these are passive traffic monitoring systems. `IDS systems` examine all connections between hosts. If the IDS finds packets containing the defined contents or specifications, the administrator is notified and takes appropriate action in the worst case.

`IPS systems` take measures configured by the administrator independently to prevent potential attacks automatically. It is essential to know that IDS and IPS are different applications and that IPS serves as a complement to IDS.

Several virtual private servers (`VPS`) with different IP addresses are recommended to determine whether such systems are on the target network during a penetration test. If the administrator detects such a potential attack on the target network, the first step is to block the IP address from which the potential attack comes. As a result, we will no longer be able to access the network using that IP address, and our Internet Service Provider (`ISP`) will be contacted and blocked from all access to the Internet.

-   `IDS systems` alone are usually there to help administrators detect potential attacks on their network. They can then decide how to handle such connections. We can trigger certain security measures from an administrator, for example, by aggressively scanning a single port and its service. Based on whether specific security measures are taken, we can detect if the network has some monitoring applications or not.

-   One method to determine whether such `IPS system` is present in the target network is to scan from a single host (`VPS`). If at any time this host is blocked and has no access to the target network, we know that the administrator has taken some security measures. Accordingly, we can continue our penetration test with another `VPS`.

Consequently, we know that we need to be quieter with our scans and, in the best case, disguise all interactions with the target network and its services.

* * * * *

### Decoys
------

There are cases in which administrators block specific subnets from different regions in principle. This prevents any access to the target network. Another example is when IPS should block us. For this reason, the Decoy scanning method (`-D`) is the right choice. With this method, Nmap generates various random IP addresses inserted into the IP header to disguise the origin of the packet sent. With this method, we can generate random (`RND`) a specific number (for example: `5`) of IP addresses separated by a colon (`:`). Our real IP address is then randomly placed between the generated IP addresses. In the next example, our real IP address is therefore placed in the second position. Another critical point is that the decoys must be alive. Otherwise, the service on the target may be unreachable due to SYN-flooding security mechanisms.

#### Scan by Using Decoys

The spoofed packets are often filtered out by ISPs and routers, even though they come from the same network range. Therefore, we can also specify our VPS servers' IP addresses and use them in combination with "`IP ID`" manipulation in the IP headers to scan the target.

Another scenario would be that only individual subnets would not have access to the server's specific services. So we can also manually specify the source IP address (`-S`) to test if we get better results with this one. Decoys can be used for SYN, ACK, ICMP scans, and OS detection scans. So let us look at such an example and determine which operating system it is most likely to be.

### DNS Proxying
------------

By default, `Nmap` performs a reverse DNS resolution unless otherwise specified to find more important information about our target. These DNS queries are also passed in most cases because the given web server is supposed to be found and visited. The DNS queries are made over the `UDP port 53`. The `TCP port 53` was previously only used for the so-called "`Zone transfers`" between the DNS servers or data transfer larger than 512 bytes. More and more, this is changing due to IPv6 and DNSSEC expansions. These changes cause many DNS requests to be made via TCP port 53.

However, `Nmap` still gives us a way to specify DNS servers ourselves (`--dns-server <ns>,<ns>`). This method could be fundamental to us if we are in a demilitarized zone (`DMZ`). The company's DNS servers are usually more trusted than those from the Internet. So, for example, we could use them to interact with the hosts of the internal network. As another example, we can use `TCP port 53` as a source port (`--source-port`) for our scans. If the administrator uses the firewall to control this port and does not filter IDS/IPS properly, our TCP packets will be trusted and passed through.

#### SYN-Scan of a Filtered Port

	sudo nmap 10.129.2.28 -p50000 -sS -Pn -n --disable-arp-ping --packet-trace

Now that we have found out that the firewall accepts `TCP port 53`, it is very likely that IDS/IPS filters might also be configured much weaker than others. We can test this by trying to connect to this port by using `Netcat`.

#### Connect To The Filtered Port

	ncat -nv --source-port 53 10.129.2.28 50000

```text

### Firewall and IDS/IPS Evasion Labs
---------------------------------

In the next three sections, we get different scenarios to practice where we have to scan our target. Firewall rules and IDS/IPS protect the systems, so we need to use the techniques shown to bypass the firewall rules and do this as quiet as possible. Otherwise, we will be blocked by IPS.

### Firewall and IDS/IPS Evasion - Easy Lab

### Firewall and IDS/IPS Evasion

* * * * *

Now let's get practical. A company hired us to test their IT security defenses, including their `IDS` and `IPS` systems. Our client wants to increase their IT security and will, therefore, make specific improvements to their `IDS/IPS` systems after each successful test. We do not know, however, according to which guidelines these changes will be made. Our goal is to find out specific information from the given situations.

We are only ever provided with a machine protected by `IDS/IPS` systems and can be tested. For learning purposes and to get a feel for how `IDS/IPS` can behave, we have access to a status web page at:

	http://<target>/status.php

This page shows us the number of alerts. We know that if we receive a specific amount of alerts, we will be `banned`. Therefore we have to test the target system as `quietly` as possible.

#### Questions

>Our client wants to know if we can identify which operating system their provided machine is running on. Submit the OS name as the answer.

	nmap -sV -F <target>

```text
PORT   STATE SERVICE VERSION
22/tcp open  ssh     OpenSSH <...> Ubuntu <...>
80/tcp open  http    Apache httpd <...> ((Ubuntu))
Service Info: OS: Linux; CPE: cpe:/o:linux:linux_kernel
```

### Firewall and IDS/IPS Evasion - Medium Lab

* * * * *

After we conducted the first test and submitted our results to our client, the administrators made some changes and improvements to the `IDS/IPS` and firewall. We could hear that the administrators were not satisfied with their previous configurations during the meeting, and they could see that the network traffic could be filtered more strictly.

#### Questions

>After the configurations are transferred to the system, our client wants to know if it is possible to find out our target's DNS server version. Submit the DNS server version of the target as the answer.
>
> Hint: During the meeting, the administrators talked about the host we tested as a publicly accessible server that was not mentioned before.
>
> `nmap -sV -p53 10.129.2.48`
```text
PORT   STATE SERVICE VERSION
53/tcp open  domain  (unknown banner: HTB{...})
```

### Firewall and IDS/IPS Evasion - Hard Lab

* * * * *

With our second test's help, our client was able to gain new insights and sent one of its administrators to a `training course` for `IDS/IPS` systems. As our client told us, the training would last `one week`. Now the administrator has taken all the necessary precautions and wants us to test this again because specific services must be changed, and the communication for the provided software had to be modified.

#### Questions

>Now our client wants to know if it is possible to find out the version of the running services. Submit the version of the service our client was talking about as the answer.
>
> Hint: Our client also mentioned that they were forced to add a service that plays a vital role for their customer because they require large amounts of data.

	sudo nmap -g 53 -p- -n -Pn --disable-arp-ping <target>

```text
PORT      STATE SERVICE
22/tcp    open  ssh
80/tcp    open  http
<port>/tcp open  ibm-db2
```

	sudo nc -nv -p 53 <target> <port>

```text
Ncat: Version <...> ( https://nmap.org/ncat )
Ncat: Connected to <target>:<port>.
220 HTB{...}
